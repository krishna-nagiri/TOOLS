This Repository contains tools that I created myself to quench my curiosity and tools that I found interesting (replicated by me)

                            << DESCRIPTION >>
                             This is the first tool that i've created for myself to install command (in my linux distro) by passing the name of the command as input in the code
                             itself.
                             The code worked fine and istalled the commands like "htop","at" etc...
                             This tool can will be pretty handy, it can check the existance of the command itself and install it if it couldn't find one.
